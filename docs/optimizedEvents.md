# lib&#x2F;optimizedEvents

OPTIMIZED EVENTS:
Creates events called "optimizedResize" and "optimizedScroll" that will listen to scroll/resize events,
optimized with requestAnimationFrame to prevent them from getting called too much. This should help
with performance, but will get called less often than the native scroll/resize events.
